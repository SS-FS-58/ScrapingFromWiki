Known for her five-octave vocal range, melismatic singing style, and signature use of the whistle register, she is referred to as the ""Songbird Supreme"" and the ""Queen of Christmas"". Carey rose to fame in 1990 with her eponymous debut album. She was the first artist to have her first five singles reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100, from ""Vision of Love"" to ""Emotions"".', 'Her debut album was released under the guidance of Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola, who married her three years later. Carey achieved worldwide success with follow-up albums Music Box (1993), Merry Christmas (1994), and Daydream (1995).

After separating from Mottola, Carey adopted a new image and incorporated more elements of hip hop into her music with the release of Butterfly (1997). Billboard named her the Artist of the Decade (1990s), while the World Music Awards honored her as the Best Selling Female Pop Artist of the Millennium.', 'After eleven consecutive years charting a U.S. number-one single, Carey parted ways with Columbia in 2001 and signed a $100 million recording contract with Virgin Records in April of that year. However, following her highly publicized physical and emotional breakdown, as well as the critical and commercial failure of her film Glitter (2001) and its accompanying soundtrack, her contract was bought out for $28 million by Virgin and she signed with Island Records the following year. After a relatively unsuccessful period, she returned to the top of music charts with The Emancipation of Mimi (2005), which became the best-selling album in the US, and the world\'s second-best-selling album, of 2005. Its second single, ""We Belong Together"", topped the US Billboard Hot 100 decade-end chart (2000s).

Her last Oscar nomination was for What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962), which also starred her famous rival Joan Crawford. In the latter stage of her career, her most successful films were Death on the Nile (1978) and The Whales of August (1987). Her career went through several periods of eclipse, but despite a long period of ill health she continued acting in film and on television until shortly before her death from breast cancer in 1989.[4]', ""She admitted that her success had often been at the expense of her personal relationships. She was married four times, divorcing three and widowed once, when her second husband died unexpectedly. She raised her children largely as a single parent. Her daughter, B. D. Hyman, wrote a controversial memoir about her childhood, 1985's My Mother's Keeper.[4]"", ""Davis was the co-founder of the Hollywood Canteen, a club venue for food, dancing and entertainment for servicemen during World War II, and was the first female president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. She was also the first woman to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute. In 1999, Davis was placed second behind Katharine Hepburn on the American Film Institute's list of the greatest female stars of the classical Hollywood cinema era.""]","['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/BETTEDavis_%28cropped%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Bette_davis_bad_sister.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Bette_davis_of_human_bondage.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Jezebel-1938-Bette-Davis.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Bette_Davis_-_Errol_Flynn.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Tracy_Davis_Publicity_Photo_Academy_Award_1939.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Bette_davis_the_little_foxes.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Davis_henreid_now_voyager.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Bette_davis_the_corn_is_green.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Bette_davis_beyond_the_forest.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Bette_Davis_and_Gary_Merrill_in_All_About_Eve.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Bette_davis_baby_jane_trailer.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Bette_Davis_William_Hopper_Perry_Mason_1963.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/DavisTaylor.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dc/BetteDavisTheWhalesofAugust.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Ronald_Reagan_with_Bette_Davis_1987.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Bette_Davis_in_Dark_Victory_trailer.jpg']"

That comedy film was a box office success and landed her a third Academy Award nomination.

When the FBI acted on an anonymous tip that Lords was a minor during her time in the industry, and that pornographers were distributing and selling these illegal images and videotapes, the resulting fallout led to prosecution of those responsible for creating and distributing.[2] In addition, all but the last of her adult films were banned as child pornography.', ""After her departure from the industry only two days after turning the legal age of 18, Lords enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute, where she studied method acting with the intention of becoming a mainstream actress.

Lords followed with the role of Wanda Woodward in John Waters's teen comedy, Cry-Baby (1990).[3] Her other acting credits included the television series MacGyver, Married... with Children, Tales from the Crypt, Roseanne, Melrose Place, Profiler, First Wave, Highlander: The Series, Gilmore Girls and Will & Grace.

Despite the poor sales of the album, the lead single ""Control"" had moderate commercial success. It peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart and was included on the soundtrack to the film Mortal Kombat (1995), which was eventually certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

She began working alongside Nichols, who was also in the group, and together they began writing and performing their own comedy sketches, which were enormously popular. In 1957, they both quit the group to form their own stage act, Nichols and May, in New York. Producer Jack Rollins said their act was ""so startling, so new, as fresh as could be. I was stunned by how really good they were.""[1]:\u200a340\u200a They performed nightly in clubs in Greenwich Village alongside Joan Rivers and Woody Allen to the mostly sold-out shows on the Broadway stage, in addition to making TV appearances and radio broadcasts. In their comedy act, they created satirical clichés and character types which made fun of the new intellectual, cultural, and social order that was just emerging at the time. In doing so, May was instrumental in removing the stereotype of women being unable to succeed at live comedy.', 'Together, Nichols and May became an inspiration to many younger comedians, including Lily Tomlin and Steve Martin. They released multiple comedy albums and received four Grammy Award nominations winning Best Comedy Album for An Evening with Mike Nichols and Elaine May in 1962. After four years, at the height of their fame, May decided to discontinue their act; she wanted to take more risks with improvisation whereas Nichols wanted to perfect the form and also direct. It also took too great an emotional toll on them both. May became a screenwriter and playwright, along with acting and directing. Their relatively brief time together as comedy stars led New York talk show host Dick Cavett to call their act ""one of the comic meteors in the sky."" Woody Allen declared, “the two of them came along and elevated comedy to a brand-new level"".[2] Journalist Gerald Nachman noted that ""Nichols and May are perhaps the most ardently missed of all the satirical comedians of their era.""[1]:\u200a319\u200a Together, they were the topic of a PBS documentary Nichols and May: Take Two (1996).', ""May starred in films infrequently throughout her career including Luv (1967), Enter Laughing (1967), and California Suite (1978). It was during this time that she became the first female director with a Hollywood deal since Ida Lupino when she directed the black screwball comedy, A New Leaf (1971), in which she also starred opposite Walter Matthau.[3] She broke the mold experimenting with genres directing a string of critically acclaimed films including her dark romantic comedy, The Heartbreak Kid (1972) starring Charles Grodin, Cybill Shepherd, and her daughter Jeannie Berlin; and her gritty gangster film, Mikey and Nicky (1976), starring John Cassavetes and Peter Falk. May has received her first Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay nomination for Warren Beatty's comedy Heaven Can Wait (1978).[4] Additionally, May wrote and directed Ishtar (1987), starring Beatty and Dustin Hoffman to a mixed reception. She reunited with Nichols, with her writing the screenplays for and he directing The Birdcage (1996) and Primary Colors (1998).
